# nrcs_temp_parser

Function to parse raw text files containing average temperature readings provided by the the Natural Resources Conservation Service 
into a tidy dataframe. The data is located on the [ftp server](https://www.wcc.nrcs.usda.gov/ftpref/data/climate/table/temperature/history/)
and the function is to be used on files containing “_tavg.txt” as we are not interested in maximum or minimum temperature readings.
